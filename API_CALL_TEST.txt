LOXONE API CALL - FROM YOUR CONFIGURATION
═══════════════════════════════════════

Your Configuration (from config server logs):
  Host: 192.168.0.99
  UUID: (contains -d138-) - Need full UUID from button

HTTP METHOD (TRY THESE URLS IN YOUR BROWSER):
==========================================
The URLs should be in this format:
http://192.168.0.99:80/dev/sps/io/{YOUR-FULL-UUID}/plus

Since I can see from the button that the UUID contains "-d138-",
once you press the button, the full UUID should appear.

From the config server, you have a control called "Verlichting Badkamer"
which is a LightControllerV2 - this might be the one you configured.


TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
====================
1. The button should show you the full UUID when pressed
2. Construct the URL manually using: http://192.168.0.99:80/dev/sps/io/{FULL-UUID}/On
3. Open that URL in your browser
4. Enter your Loxone credentials when prompted
5. If the light turns on, then HTTP works!

Alternative commands to try:
- /On    - Turn on
- /Off   - Turn off
- /plus  - Toggle
- /100   - Full brightness
- /0     - Off


WHY THE FILE ISN'T UPDATING:
============================
The plugin code is trying to write to this file when you press the button,
but it seems the file write is failing or the button press isn't being
detected. This could be because:
1. The fs (filesystem) module isn't working in the plugin context
2. The button is configured for a different action
3. There's a permissions issue

Let me know if the button shows a green checkmark when you press it.
